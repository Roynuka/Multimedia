## Multimedia Portfolio ##

This is my Portfolio based on my journey throughout this semester with Multimedia & Development.

### Learning Resources

Throughout this semester we have been given a variety of resources in order to help us along the way with the new types of software for our projects and assessments. Each week we learned new things regarding different types of Multimedia and how they we're being created in a variety of ways. From Adobe Photoshop for Image manipulation, Adobe Illustrator for creating graphics and illustrations, Adobe Premiere Pro for video editing, and now currently Adobe Animate for our animation.

Resources were easy to come by but learning how to use it was just a matter of putting the time and effor into it. [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/SharedPlaylist/b43406c327eb4a149568532ca17ffbfd?org=op.ac.nz) had some more tutorials for us which definitely helped me at times.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Roynuka/Multimedia/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
